    and 6b is not based on the end-user's consent or on a Union or Member State law
    which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to
    safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 11, the provider of electronic
    communications networks and services shall, in order to ascertain whether processing
    for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the electronic
    communications metadata are initially collected, take into account, inter alia:

(a) any link between the purposes for which the electronic communications metadata
    have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing;

(b) the context in which the electronic communications metadata have been collected, in
    particular regarding the relationship between end-users concerned and the provider;

(c) the nature of the electronic communications metadata as well as the modalities of the
    intended further processing, in particular where such data or the intended further processing
    could reveal categories of data, pursuant to Article 9 or 10 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;

(d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for end-users;

(e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, such as pseudonymisation and encryption.

(b) the processing is limited to electronic communications metadata that is
    pseudonymised, and

(c) the electronic communications metadata is not used to determine the nature or
    characteristics of an end-user or to build a profile of an end-user.

3. For the purposes of this Article, the providers of electronic
    communications networks and services shall:

(a) not share such data with third parties, unless it is made anonymous;

(b) prior to the processing carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged
    processing operations on the protection of electronic communications data in

    prior consultation of the supervisory authority in accordance with Article 36(1)
    to (3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679; and

(c) inform the end-user of specific processing on the basis of this Article and
    of the right to object to such processing free of charge, at any time, and in an
    easy and effective manner. If the end-user objects, the electronic communications
    metadata shall no longer be processed for such purposes.

    for the sole purpose of preventing child sexual abuse and exploitation by detecting,
    deleting and reporting material as defined in Article 2(c) of Directive 2011/93/EU, if the processing
    meets all of the following characteristics:

    (i) it creates a unique, non-reconvertible digital signature (“hash”) of material
        attached to electronic communications for the sole purpose of comparing that
        hash with a database containing hashes of material previously reliably identified
        as constituting material defined in Article 2(c) of Directive 2011/93/EU;

    (ii) electronic communications data and hashes of material attached to electronic
        communications are erased immediately after comparison with the database
        except in the cases where material constituting material defined in Article 2(c)

2. The provider of number-independent interpersonal communications services
    shall, prior to processing, carry out an assessment of the impact and consult the
    supervisory authority, in accordance with Article 35 and 36 of Regulation (EU)
    2016/679. The assessment of impact shall include a description of the processing
    activities concerning both automatic and manual processing of the data,
    including description of possible algorithms or databases used for the
    processing and means to limit the rate of erroneous detection of material
    constituting defined in Article 2(c) of Directive 2011/93/EU and of the security measures, including
    limitation of personnel authorised to access electronic communications data, set
    up to protect end-users not involved in the communication of material

    purpose of billing in accordance with point (b) of Article 6b, the relevant metadata
    may be kept until the end of the period during which a bill may lawfully be
    challenged or a payment may be pursued in accordance with national law.

4. Union or Member state law may provide that the electronic communications metadata 
    is retained, to safeguard the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution

```
1. Regardless of whether the calling end-user has prevented the presentation of the
    calling line identification, where emergency communications are made to emergency services, providers of
    number-based interpersonal communications services shall
    override the elimination of the presentation of the calling line identification and the
    denial or absence of consent of an end-user for the processing of metadata, on a per-

    public safety answering points, for the purpose of responding to such
    communications.

1a. Regardless whether the called end-user rejects incoming calls where the presentation
    of the calling line identification has been prevented by the calling end-user, providers
    of number-based interpersonal communications services shall override this choice,
    where technically possible, when the calling end-user is an organisation dealing with
    emergency communications, including public safety answering points, for the purpose
    of responding to such communications.

    Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) capabilities or other types of
    terminal equipment based location data through the terminal
    equipment settings, when a call is made to emergency services, such settings may not
    prevent access to such location data to determine and provide the calling end-user's location to

    temporary basis, where end-users request the tracing of unwanted, malicious or
    nuisance calls. 

2. Providers of number-based interpersonal communications services shall
    also provide the called end-user with the following possibilities, free of charge:

(a) to block, where technically feasible, incoming calls from specific numbers or from anonymous sources or from
